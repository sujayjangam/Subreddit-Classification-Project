    "On a website known as Reddit, there are many subcommunities, known as subreddits, that discuss questions, advice, progress, and even frustrations around Nutrition and the many different diet styles. There are those dedicated to low/no carbohydrates as well. Within each subreddit, users can create text or image posts, and upvote or downvote posts to express approval or disapproval regarding the content of the post. The number of upvotes and downvotes are fed into a hot-ranking algorithm to determine a score for the post, with higher scoring posts rising to the top of the subreddit."

    "Given the rise in popularity of low/no carb diets, clients at MyNutrition Clinic have been requesting to be put on either a [Ketogenic](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-101) or a [Zerocarb (carnivore)](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/carnivore-diet) diet. *(Some resources describing what these diets are have been linked)*. <br>\n",
    "<p>This is based on the client's \"I want to lose weight quickly\" mentality, as well as their own additional research.\n",
    "However we are concerned that this may result in \"yo-yo dieting\", where the client rebounds from the diet, either by quitting the diet because its too difficult, or ending the diet because they reached their short term goal, or by losing control and binge eating.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This rebound ends our clients up in a worse shape than when they started. If a client is fasely identified as belonging to the `zerocarb` group, and they eventually rebound, this rebound is worse, than a rebound for the `keto` diet, as the `zerocarb` diet is generally accepted as being the \"harder\" diet with more restrictions. As such, we ask ourselves the question, **Can we build a classification model to classify our clients into each group based on subreddit data, and minimize false positives especially when it comes to the `zerocarb` group**."
